# personal lanterna documentation guide
In these files, you will find a "getting started" guide for making applications with lanterna.
I am writing this guide to further develop my own understanding of lanterna using the "learning via teaching"
approach. these files will include information ranging from basic startup to semi advanced info and options for 
different data types within lanterna.

disclaimer: none of this is official, and this is purely for the purpose of furthering my own understanding, lanterna has
its own documentation, and it can be found [here (GitHub readme)](https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna/blob/master/docs/contents.md) or [here (JavaDoc)](http://mabe02.github.io/lanterna/apidocs/3.1/overview-summary.html)

## getting started/basic info
1. [adding lanterna to your project](getting-started-setup.md)
2. [making your first project (unfinished)](basic-file-setup.md)

## gui elements
- [windows (unfinished)](windows.md)

## theming and customization
