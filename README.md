# testing repository for the java/kotlin lanterna library
this repository is for me to learn and become comfortable with the lanterna library for java, I am implimenting this library in kotlin to make experimental text UIs. 
lanterna is a TUI library similar to ncurses but for java, it can run on any xterminal or create its own emulated swing terminal.
